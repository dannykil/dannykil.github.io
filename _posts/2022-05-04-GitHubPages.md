title:  "File Naming Policies in GitHub Pages"

##### Notice below

When you create a new .md file in Github pages,
you have to avoid naming files like 

1. Special Characters like !, @, #...
2. Blank between words
3. path like 'accountID.github.io/_posts/' 

It's easy to remember that you can make a file like only '2022-05-04-filename.md'
That it.
